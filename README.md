- [parceljs](https://parceljs.org/)
- react
- react-dom
- sass

Node version in use:<br>
`v16.13.0`

Run `npm install` locally to install all required modules.

Run `npm run start` to start the live server locally.

## Things I've added to get you up and running

In the `index.html` file, I've added the bare minimum.<br>

In `index.js`, you can replace the code with your React app.<br>

The code below will only apply in development.<br>

> Hot Module Replacement (HMR) improves the development experience by automatically updating modules in the browser at runtime without needing a whole page refresh. This means that application state can be retained as you change small things.

```javascript
if (module.hot) {
  module.hot.accept();
}
```

## HMR (Hot Module Replacement)

You might have noticed in `package.json` this line:

```
"start": "parcel src/index.html --port 1234 --hmr-port 4326 --host localhost"
```

Normally it would be enough to just enter:

```
"start": "parcel src/index.html"
```

HMR might fail on some machines hence the need to specify `--port`, `--hmr-port` and `--host`.
